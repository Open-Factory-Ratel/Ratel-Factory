/**
 * Ratel Observatory Dashboard — Pi Extension
 *
 * Registers a `view_observatory` tool that launches the Ratel Observatory
 * dashboard server. The orchestrator can call this tool to give the user
 * a live view of factory activity (agent lifecycles, tool calls, parse
 * status, phase transitions).
 *
 * The dashboard is a READ-ONLY view over the events.jsonl file written by
 * the EventLogger in event-logger.ts. It does not modify any state.
 *
 * Browser launch strategy (Phase 2):
 *   - ctx.notify shows a TUI toast with the URL (interactive mode only)
 *   - The server also prints the URL to stdout (works in all modes)
 *   - No auto-open: the user clicks the URL or copies it
