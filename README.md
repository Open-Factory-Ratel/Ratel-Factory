## What is Ratel?

Ratel is an **AI Software Factory** — a framework designed for running autonomous, end-to-end software development missions. It orchestrates specialised LLM agents to plan, implement, and validate software projects while maintaining strict, deterministic control over process scheduling, repository isolation, schema validation, persistence, and branch integration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core Philosophy:** 
> * **Deterministic Code** owns the structural framework: database schemas, local persistence, execution timeouts, agent routing, and completion logic.
> * **Model Agents** own the cognitive work: task planning, source implementation, test creation, code reviews, and product judgment.
> * **Non-Bypassable Gates** ensure that features can only be merged into the main codebase when they pass all validators with zero high-severity issues.

---

## Key Features

*   ⚙️ **Deterministic Process Control** — Rigid validation gates, timeouts, and state machines ensure agent pipelines are stable and reproducible.
*   🛰️ **Live Observatory Dashboard** — Web-based monitoring interface showing live timelines, stdout streams, active git diffs, and validation feedback.
*   📄 **Interactive Widescreen Plan Review** — Review and modify the generated validation contracts and Gherkin feature files in real-time from your browser before launching missions.
*   🛠️ **Automated Sharded Testing** — Coordinates parallel user-testing shards to run automated browser and integration scenarios in isolated environments.
*   🔄 **Automatic Validation Recovery** — Identifies and attempts automatic correction of compilation, lint, or runtime errors before submitting final reports.

---

## Installation & Setup

The primary supported end-user path is the **OpenCode adapter**. It installs the Ratel service, the OpenCode plugin, command stubs, and the bundled `ratel-factory` skill.

### 1. Automated Installation (OpenCode)

```bash
curl -fsSL http://209.97.168.207/install-opencode.sh | bash
```

This script will automatically:
*   Install the latest `@ratel-factory/core` and `@ratel-factory/opencode` packages from npm.
*   Add the `@ratel-factory/opencode` plugin hook configuration inside your `opencode.json`.
*   Install command stubs (`/ratel`, `/ratel-mission`, `/ratel-observatory`) and the `ratel-factory` OpenCode skill.
*   Clean up stale legacy packages, stale `.ratel/service.json` metadata, and running Ratel service processes so an outdated service cannot be reused.

After installing, open OpenCode in a project and run:

```text
/ratel
```

`/ratel` is a health command only: it pings all factory agents and does not start a mission or inspect the codebase.

### 2. Pi SDK (development / direct mode)

```bash
curl -fsSL http://209.97.168.207/install-pi.sh | bash
```

Once completed, activate the extension inside your Pi session:
```bash
pi install @ratel-factory/pi-extension
```

This registers lifecycle hooks, state restoration, and custom toolsets inside the Pi runtime context. Direct Pi mode is mainly for Ratel adapter/core development.

### 3. Manual Source Setup (Development Mode)

If you are developing custom adapters, dashboard components, or core tools, build the codebase from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ratel-web

# Install package dependencies
npm install

# Build all packages
npm run build:all

# Start the factory in direct, interactive mode
npm run dev
```

**Installer flags:**
- `--dev` — Install from local workspace instead of npm
- `--help` — Show usage

**Example:**
```bash
bash install/install-opencode.sh --dev
```

---

## Architecture

Ratel separates client-side platform hooks (Adapters) from factory scheduling and orchestration logic (Core), running either as a standalone service or in direct in-process mode.

### Canonical Core Package

There is **one canonical core**: `@ratel-factory/core`. All factory logic lives in `packages/core/src/`.

- **Core Service** (`@ratel-factory/core`) — runs as a standalone HTTP service. All state lives here.
- **Adapters** are thin HTTP clients that register tools/commands with the agent's extension API.
- **Direct mode** — `src/adapters/pi-sdk/main.ts` runs the core in-process without the HTTP layer (for development).
- **Legacy source** (`src/core/`, `src/observatory/`) is a deprecated path that has been ported into `packages/core/src/`. The architecture guard (`npm run check:canonical-core`) blocks any resurrection.

**Key rule:** The service is authoritative. Adapters may cache UI state for display purposes, but all durable mission and job state lives in the service.

### Adapter Architecture

Ratel uses a **service-first** architecture:

- **Core Service** (`@ratel-factory/core`) — runs as a standalone HTTP service. All state lives here.
- **Adapters** are thin HTTP clients that register tools/commands with the agent's extension API.
- **Direct mode** — `src/adapters/pi-sdk/main.ts` runs the core in-process without the HTTP layer (for development).

**Key rule:** The service is authoritative. Adapters may cache UI state for display purposes, but all durable mission and job state lives in the service.

### Key Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Adapter Layer** | Client-side wrappers (`src/adapters`) that map Ratel tools and slash commands into native agent environments (OpenCode CLI, Pi Interactive TUI). |
| **Orchestrator** | Coordinates the lifecycle flow, schedules agent sessions, and manages state checkpoints. |
| **Research Agent** | Inspects the repository and codebase structure to identify dependencies and constraints in a read-only environment. |
| **Contract Writer** | Formulates the high-level `validation-contract.md` and generates individual Gherkin `.feature` specifications. |
| **Worker Agent** | Implements code changes in parallel git branches under test-driven development (TDD). |
| **Scrutiny Validator** | Automatically verifies code syntax, typings, lints, and executes code reviews on worker submissions. |
| **User-Testing Coordinator** | Schedules sharded browser runs using cucumber frameworks to verify user flows. |
| **Observatory Dashboard** | Node HTTP web dashboard (`src/observatory`) used for monitoring timelines, viewing file diffs, and reviewing Gherkin plans. |

---

## How It Works

### Mission Lifecycle Phases

1.  **Intake**: The orchestrator receives the goal specification from the user.
2.  **Discovery**: Agents inspect the directory structure and existing code libraries to ensure compatibility.
3.  **Clarification**: The system resolves ambiguous requirements through interactive CLI prompts.
4.  **Constraint Analysis**: Identifies technological boundaries, non-goals, and dependency requirements.
5.  **Validation Contract**: The contract agent drafts high-level verification criteria and details scenarios.
6.  **Feature Decomposition**: Deconstructs the contract into concrete feature directories with automated checks.
7.  **User Approval**: The user reviews the plan and feature specifications in the browser dashboard.
8.  **Execution**: Worker subagents code, write tests, and integrate features serially upon successful validations.

### Workspace Isolation

Ratel enforces rigorous Git safety gates to prevent agent-owned modifications from polluting your primary codebase:
*   The orchestrator auto-discovers or sets up a clean `integration` branch.
*   Worker agents spawn a separate feature branch (`feat/F1`, `feat/F2`, etc.) for each milestone.
*   A feature is only merged back to `integration` upon passing all security and execution checks.

### Feature Lifecycle: `integrated` vs `validated`

The factory uses two distinct states for features to separate "code is merged" from "code is verified":

*   **`integrated`** — the worker handoff was clean, workspace finalization succeeded, and the commit is reachable from the `integration` branch. The orchestrator may **not** mark a feature `integrated` directly; only the deterministic `mark_feature_integrated` gate (or equivalent tool) can write this status.
*   **`validated`** — milestone validation (scrutiny + user testing) passed with zero blocking issues and all automated checks green. Only the validation finalization logic may transition `integrated` → `validated`.

Legacy aliases (`complete`, `completed`) are normalized to `integrated` on read.

### Feature Completion Gate

A feature is strictly blocked from completion unless the following requirements are met:
*   The worker submits a valid, parseable handoff report (`parseStatus: "ok"`).
*   No `leftUndone` items exist in the feature manifest.
*   Zero high-severity issues or compiler warnings are discovered by the validators.
*   Workspace finalization successfully completes a git merge.

---

## Configuration

Ratel is configured via a global `ratel.json` file in the root directory:

```json
{
  "name": "ratel",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "observability": {
    "enabled": true,
    "port": 8765,
    "autoOpen": false
  },
  "orchestrator": {
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "thinkingLevel": "medium",
    "defaultSkills": [
      "grill-with-docs",
      "parallel-web-search"
    ]
  },
  "workers": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet",
    "defaultTools": ["read", "bash", "edit", "write"]
  },
  "validators": {
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "defaultTools": ["read", "bash", "grep"]
  },
  "budget": {
    "maxCostUsd": 50,
    "maxTotalTokens": 5000000,
    "maxWallClockMinutes": 480,
    "maxAgentRuns": 200
  },
  "fallbackModels": {
    "orchestrator": {
      "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
      "fallbackModels": ["anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet"]
    },
    "worker": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet",
      "fallbackModels": []
    },
    "validator": {
      "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
      "fallbackModels": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Budget configuration** (`budget`):
- `maxCostUsd` — maximum total cost per mission (default: 50).
- `maxTotalTokens` — maximum total tokens per mission (default: 5,000,000).
- `maxWallClockMinutes` — wall-clock budget in minutes (default: 480).
- `maxAgentRuns` — maximum agent sessions per mission (default: 200).
- Budgets are enforced at the start of every agent turn and recorded in `usage.jsonl`.
- If any budget limit is exceeded, the mission halts with a non-retryable error.

**Fallback model configuration** (`fallbackModels`):
- `orchestrator`, `worker`, `validator` each have a primary `model` and an ordered list of `fallbackModels`.
- When a retryable provider error occurs (429, 503, timeout, network reset), the orchestrator transparently retries with the next fallback model.
- Non-retryable errors (401, 403, context overflow, content policy, budget exceeded) do **not** trigger fallback.
- Model health is tracked via a circuit breaker (open after `failureThreshold` consecutive retryable failures, half-open after `cooldownMs`).

> [!TIP]
> Model configurations map to the Pi SDK registry. You can override active models per-session using the CLI `set_model` tool.

### Testing

The factory has 77 tests covering:
- Workspace resolution with explicit directories
- Feature completion gate enforcement
- Report submission and parsing
- JSONL robustness
- Mission schema normalization
- Integration preflight checks
- User-testing shard aggregation
- Validation recovery semantics

### Observatory Dashboard

When the factory starts, it launches a read-only observatory dashboard:
- URL: `http://localhost:8765` (auto-falls back if port busy)
- Shows: agent spans, tool calls, parse status, phase transitions, halt events
- Data source: `.missions/current/events.jsonl`

---

## Adapters

### OpenCode Plugin (`@ratel-factory/opencode`)

Current prepared package version: `@ratel-factory/opencode@0.1.4` with `@ratel-factory/core@0.1.2`.

**Commands:**
- `/ratel` — Ping factory health and all six factory agents. This is health/status only: it does **not** start a mission, inspect the codebase, or modify project state.
- `/ratel-mission` — Show current mission status
- `/ratel-observatory` — Open Observatory dashboard

**Factory agents pinged by `/ratel`:**
- `research`
- `smart_friend`
- `contract_writer`
- `worker`
- `scrutiny_validator`
- `user_testing_validator`

**Tools:**
- `ratel_start_mission` — Start a new mission with a goal
- `ratel_get_status` — Get mission status
- `ratel_run_worker` — Run a worker for a feature
- `ratel_run_validation` — Run validation for a milestone
- `ratel_ping_agents` — Ping all factory agents and report per-agent health

**Service lifecycle:**
- The plugin auto-discovers a local Ratel service using `.ratel/service.json` in the project root.
- If no healthy service exists, it starts `ratel --serve` for the project.
- The plugin rejects filesystem-root worktrees such as `/` and falls back to the actual OpenCode directory so `ratel.json` is found correctly.

**Auth bridge:**
- The plugin reuses existing OpenCode API credentials, especially `opencode-go`, by bridging OpenCode auth into Pi/Ratel auth.
- V1 defaults to using the same OpenCode model for all factory agents. Users can later change specific agent models in `ratel.json`.

### Pi Extension (`@ratel-factory/pi-extension`)

**Commands:**
- `/ratel` — Toggle factory mode
- `/ratel-mission` — Show current mission status
- `/ratel-observatory` — Open Observatory dashboard

**Tools:**
- `ratel_start_mission` — Start a new mission
- `ratel_run_worker` — Run a worker for a feature
- `ratel_run_validator` — Run validation for a milestone

**Lifecycle hooks:**
- `session_start` — Restore persisted phase state
- `before_agent_start` — Inject factory context
- `turn_end` — Track phase transitions based on tool usage
- `tool_call` — Gate writes during planning phase

### Service API

All requests return immediately with a job ID. Clients poll `GET /api/v1/missions/:missionId/jobs/:jobId` or consume the SSE stream (`GET /api/v1/missions/:missionId/events/stream`) for real-time updates.

**v1 API:**

```bash
GET  /health                              → { status: "ok" }
POST /api/v1/missions                     → { goal: string } → 202 { missionId, jobId }
GET  /api/v1/missions/:missionId          → { missionId, goal, status, ... }
GET  /api/v1/missions/:missionId/jobs     → { jobs: [...] }
GET  /api/v1/missions/:missionId/jobs/:jobId → { jobId, status, attempt, ... }
POST /api/v1/missions/:missionId/jobs/:jobId/cancel → { status: "cancelled" }
POST /api/v1/missions/:missionId/workers  → { featureId } → 202 { jobId, status: "queued" }
POST /api/v1/missions/:missionId/validations → { milestoneId } → 202 { jobId, status: "queued" }
POST /api/v1/missions/:missionId/user-testing → { milestoneId } → 202 { jobId, status: "queued" }
POST /api/v1/missions/:missionId/approval → { approved: bool, feedback?, files? } → 202 { jobId, status: "queued" }
GET  /api/v1/missions/:missionId/events   → { events: [...] }
GET  /api/v1/missions/:missionId/events/stream → SSE stream
GET  /api/observatory/status              → { enabled, url }
```

**Deprecated routes** (still supported with `Deprecation: true` header):
```bash
POST /api/mission/start   → 200 { missionId, jobId }
GET  /api/mission/status  → 200 { missionId, status, jobs }
POST /api/mission/worker  → 200 { missionId, featureId, jobId, status }
POST /api/mission/validate → 200 { missionId, milestoneId, jobId, status }
GET  /api/mission/artifacts → 200 { artifacts }
```

### Durable State

- **Mission state** is isolated under `.ratel/missions/<missionId>/`.
- Each mission directory contains: `mission.json`, `state.json`, `features.json`, `milestones.json`, `decision-log.md`, `budget.json`, `usage.jsonl`, `events.jsonl`, `approval.json`, `handoffs/`, `worker-runs/`, `validation-reports/`, `validation-receipts/`.
- **Jobs** are stored per-mission under `.ratel/missions/<missionId>/jobs/<jobId>.json`.
- Jobs survive process restart because they are file-backed, not in-memory. The control plane recovers expired leases on startup.
- **Budget and usage** are persisted atomically in `budget.json` and append-only in `usage.jsonl`.
- **Approval** is stored as `approval.json` and the orchestrator resumes from the next `continue_orchestrator` job after restart.
- **Token/cost records** are deduplicated by `recordId`; replaying the same record after restart is idempotent.

### Legacy Migration

If `.missions/current` exists (the legacy layout) and `.ratel/migration-v1.json` does not, the control plane performs a one-time migration on startup:
1. Reads legacy `state.json` to extract the mission/trace ID.
2. Copies `.missions/current` contents into `.ratel/missions/<missionId>/`.
3. Writes `.ratel/migration-v1.json` and `.ratel/current-mission.json`.
4. The legacy directory is **never deleted**.

The migration is idempotent: if `migration-v1.json` exists, nothing happens.

## Philosophy & Constraints

**What the factory controls (deterministic):**
- Branch detection, workspace finalization
- Parse/report schema validation
- Timeouts, raw output persistence
- Shard IDs, concurrency limits
- Artifact paths, aggregate bookkeeping

**What models control (judgment):**
- Planning, implementation decisions
- Pass/fail judgment on validation
- Product issue severity and rationale
- Scope interpretation

**Anti-patterns the factory avoids:**
- Hard-coded scenario severity rules
- Deterministic product behavior rules
- Replacing validators with deterministic BDD runners
- Heavy deterministic state machines
